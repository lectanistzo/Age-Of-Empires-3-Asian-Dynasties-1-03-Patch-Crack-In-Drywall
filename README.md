## Step 1: Prepare the Materials and Tools
     
Before you start repairing the drywall cracks, you need to gather the following materials and tools:
     
- A utility knife or a drywall saw
- A metal or plastic mesh tape
- A joint compound or a spackle
- A putty knife or a trowel
- A sandpaper or a sanding sponge
- A primer and a paint
- A paintbrush or a roller

You can find these materials and tools at your local hardware store or online.
     
## Step 2: Cut Out the Damaged Area
     
The first step to fix the drywall cracks is to cut out the damaged area. You need to do this to remove any loose or crumbling pieces of drywall and to create a smooth surface for the repair. Here's how to do it:

1. Use a utility knife or a drywall saw to cut along the edges of the crack. Make sure to cut at least half an inch beyond the crack on each side.
2. Remove the cut piece of drywall and dispose of it properly.
3. If there are any nails or screws in the cut area, remove them with a hammer or a screwdriver.
4. Clean the cut area with a damp cloth or a vacuum cleaner to remove any dust or debris.

You should now have a rectangular hole in your drywall where the crack was.

## Step 3: Apply the Mesh Tape
     
The next step to fix the drywall cracks is to apply the mesh tape. You need to do this to cover the hole and provide support for the joint compound or spackle. Here's how to do it:

1. Cut a piece of mesh tape that is slightly larger than the hole in your drywall.
2. Place the mesh tape over the hole and press it firmly onto the surrounding drywall.
3. If the hole is large, you may need to use more than one piece of mesh tape. Make sure to overlap them by at least an inch.
4. If the hole is near a corner or an edge, you may need to fold the mesh tape to fit the shape of the wall.

You should now have a mesh tape covering the hole in your drywall.
     
## Step 4: Apply the Joint Compound or Spackle
     
The final step to fix the drywall cracks is to apply the joint compound or spackle. You need to do this to fill in the hole and smooth out the surface. Here's how to do it:

1. Use a putty knife or a trowel to scoop out some joint compound or spackle from its container.
2. Apply it over the mesh tape and spread it evenly with your tool.
3. Make sure to cover all the edges and corners of the hole and blend it with the surrounding drywall.
4. If necessary, apply more layers of joint compound or spackle until you achieve a smooth and level surface.
5. Let the joint compound or spackle dry completely according to the manufacturer's instructions.

You should now have a filled and smooth hole in your drywall.
     
## Step 5: Sand and Paint the Repaired Area
     
The last step to fix the drywall cracks is to sand and paint the repaired area. You need to do this to make the repair invisible and match the rest of the wall. Here's how to do it:

1. Use a sandpaper or a sanding sponge to lightly sand the repaired area. Be careful not to damage the surrounding drywall or the mesh tape.
2. Wipe off any dust or residue with a damp cloth or a vacuum cleaner.
3. Apply a primer over the repaired area with a paintbrush or a roller. Let it dry completely according to the manufacturer's instructions.
4. Apply a paint that matches the color and finish of your wall over the primed area with a paintbrush or a roller. Let it dry completely according to the manufacturer's instructions.
5. If necessary, apply more coats of paint until you achieve a uniform and seamless look.

You should now have a repaired and painted drywall that looks as good as new.
